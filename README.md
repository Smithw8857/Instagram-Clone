# Instagram-Clone

## The goal of this project was to recreate a database similar to that of Instagram's 

The first step in achieving this goal was laying out the schema for our future database.

**Taking a look at Instagram and its structure assisted me in laying out what tables needed to be created as well as how each table to relate with one another**

**As seen above, Instagram stores**


-users

-photos/pictures

-likes

-comments

-hashtags

-followers

-followees


**In order to achieve my goal, I would need to create these elements as tables in my database**
