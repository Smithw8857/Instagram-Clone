# Instagram-Clone

## The goal of this project was to recreate a database similar to that of Instagram's 

The first step in achieving this goal was laying out the schema for our future database.

**Taking a look at Instagram and its structure assisted me in laying out what tables needed to be created as well as how each table to relate with one another**

**As seen below Instagram stores**
