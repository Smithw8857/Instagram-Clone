# Instagram-Clone

## The goal of this project was to recreate a database similar to that of Instagram's 

The first step in achieving this goal was laying out the schema design for our future database.

**Taking a look at Instagram and its structure assisted me in laying out what tables needed to be created as well as how each table would relate to one another**

**As seen above, Instagram stores**


-users

-photos/pictures

-likes

-comments

-hashtags

-followers

-followees


**In order to achieve my goal, I would need to create tables representing these elements in my database**


### *Users Table*

**users** |     |            | 
----------|-----|------------|
  id      | int | primary key
  username| varchar(255) | unique
  created_at| timestamp | 
 

### *Photos Table**

**photos** |      |         |
-----------|------|---------|
id         | 
image_url  |
user_id    |
created_at |
