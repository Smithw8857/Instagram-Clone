# Instagram-Clone

## The goal of this project was to recreate a database similar to that of Instagram's 

The first step in achieving this goal was laying out the schema design for our future database.

**Taking a look at Instagram and its structure assisted me in laying out what tables needed to be created, their structure and how each table would relate to one another**

**As seen above, Instagram stores**

 * users

 * photos/pictures

 * likes

 * comments

 * hashtags

 * followers

 * followees


**In order to achieve my goal, I would need to create tables representing these elements in my database**




### **Schema Design**



#### **Users Table**

**users** |     |            |     |
:----------:|:-----:|:------------:|:-----:|
  **id**      | int | auto_increment | primary key
  **username** | varchar(255) | unique
  **created_at** | timestamp default(now) | 
 

My first step in creating an Instagram database was to create a table to store users

 **The users table contains 3 columns**
   - an id column
   - a username column
   - a created_at column
   
The **id** column is set to auto increment, allowing each new stored user to be automatically issued an id number. the id column is also a primary key, requiring the id value to be unique as well as to prevent any null variables.

The **username** column is set to be unique, requiring each username to be distinct.

The **created_at** column is set to be a timestamp. When a new user is entered the timestamp value will default to the current time and date that the user was entered.


Next, I created the photos table.

#### **Photos Table**

**photos** |      |       |             |
:-----------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
**id** | int | auto_increment | primary key | 
**image_url** | varchar(255) | not null |
**user_id** | int | not null | foreign key references users(id) |
**created_at** | timestamp default(now) |


**The photos table contains 3 columns**
   - an id column
   - an image_url column
   - a user_id column
   - a created_at column


The **id** column is set to auto increment, allowing each new stored photo to be automatically issued an id number. the id column is also a primary key, requiring the id value to be unique as well as to prevent any null variables.

The **image_url** column is set to not null, requiring a value to be filled in the image_url column

The **user_id** column is set to not null, requiring a value to be filled in the **user_id** column, therefore requiring each photo submitted to be related to a user in the database. This is achieved by making the **user_id** column a foreign key that references the **id** column from the **users** table. This allows the photos table to not only store the information of each inserted photo, but also store which user submitted each photo, signified by their **id** number stored in the **users** table.

The **created_at column** is set to be a timestamp. When a new photo is entered the timestamp value will default to the current time and date that the photo was entered.

I required values from both the users and photos tables in order to create a proper comments table. With those completed, I started creating the table that would store user comments.  


#### **Comments Table**

**comments** |     |     |         |
:-------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|
**id** | int | auto_increment | primary key |
**comment_text** | varchar(255) | not null|
**user_id** | int | not null | foreign key references users(id) |
**photo_id** | int | not null | foreign key references photos(id) | 
**created_at** | timestamp default(now) |

**The comments table contains 3 columns**
   - an id column
   - an comment_text column
   - a user_id column
   - a photo_id column
   - a created_at column


The **id** column is set to auto increment, allowing each new stored comment to be automatically issued an id number. the id column is also a primary key, requiring the id value to be unique as well as to prevent any null variables.

The **comment_text** column is set to not null, requiring a value to be filled in the **comment_text** column preventing users from submitting any blank comments.

The **user_id** column is set to not null, requiring a value to be filled in the **user_id** column, therefore requiring each comment submitted to be related to a user in the database. This is achieved by making the **user_id** column a foreign key that references the **id** column from the **users** table. This allows the comments table to not only store each comment made, but also store which user wrote each, signified by their **id** number stored in the **users** table.

The **photo_id** column is set to not null, requiring a value to be filled in the **photo_id** column, therefore requiring each comment submitted to be related to a photo in the database. This is achieved by making the **photo_id** column a foreign key that references the **id** column from the **photos** table. This allows the comments table to store which user made the comment as well as which photo the comment was made on.

The **created_at column** is set to be a timestamp. When a new comment is written the timestamp value will default to the current time and date that the comment was entered.

#### **Likes Table**

**likes** |      |      |        |
:----------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|
**user_id** | int | not null | foreign key
**photo_id** | int | not null | foreign key
**created_at** | timestamp |


#### **Follows Table**

**follows** |      |       |        |        |
:------------:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|
**follower_id** | int | not null | foreign key | primary key |
**followee_id** | int | not null | foreign key | primary key |
**created_at** | timestamp |



#### Hashtag Tables

**tags** |      |       |         |
:---------:|:------:|:-------:|:---------:|
**id** | int | auto increment | primary key |
**tag_name** | varchar(255) | unique |
**created_at** | timestamp | 



**photo_tags** |       |      |        |         |
:---------:|:-------:|:------:|:--------:|:---------:|
**photo_id** | int | not null | foreign key| primary key |
**tag_id** | int | not null | foriegn key | primary key |
